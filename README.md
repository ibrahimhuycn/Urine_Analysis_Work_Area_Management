# CLSI LIS2-A2
Trying to implement LIS2-A2 from VisualBasic.NET

Urine Analysis Work Area Management (U-WAM) is collecion of analysers and their managemnt software by Sysmex.
I will be testing the standard by communicating with U-WAM.

I should have named this better.

As you might have noticed, I do not have anyone working with me. So.., any help you can provide most welcome.
